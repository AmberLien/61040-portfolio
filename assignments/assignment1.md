## Domains

1. **Collecting Poems**: I collect poems to carry with me throughout the day.

2. **Drawing Realism**: I draw realism which helps me appreciate the world around me through observation.

3. **Cooking**: When I cook family recipes, I feel connected with my heritage.

4. **Listening to Music**: When I listen to music, I look for songs that I can’t stop replaying.

5. **Following Analyses**: I follow analyses to see my favorite pastimes (e.g., F1, _Percy Jackson_) in new ways and connect with others.

6. **Learning Languages**: I learn languages to stay connected with my family.

7. **Studying Anatomy**: I explore anatomy to understand the body’s intricate design.

8. **Learning about Space**: Learning about space allows me to marvel at the mysteries of the universe.

9. **Making Education Accessible**: Exploring resources, opportunities, research, and career paths allows me to plan my future and guide others.

10. **Exploring Medical Research**: I follow medical research to understand cutting-edge discoveries and connect with my premed friends.

### Selected Domains

1. **Exploring Medical Research**

   Through proofreading friends’ abstracts and papers, I’ve learned about topics that affect me, like the gut microbiome, and innovations like AI in radiology. However, I often struggle to fully understand what I read due to medical terminology. Finding a way to make this information more accessible would help me focus on the clarity and structure of what I'm proofreading.

2. **Making Education Accessible**

   When I came to MIT, I discovered dozens of activities and career paths I hadn’t known existed — Science Olympiads, computing competitions, etc. Having the chance to explore these activities and fields earlier would have been exciting and made the decision of choosing a career path feel more manageable. I want to explore ways to connect students with resources and opportunities earlier.

3. **Collecting Poems**

   After reading “Wild Geese” by Mary Oliver, I began collecting poems to revisit and reflect on. Right now, my process is scattered – I browse different forums, follow conversations, and find poems I like through luck. I hope for an easier way to discover new poems and better understand which styles resonate with me.

## Problems

### Domain 1: Exploring Medical Research

1. **Doctors Using Outdated Technologies**: Healthcare professionals may rely on outdated methods or tools because emerging research is separated across different fields.

   I chose not to select this problem because of its broad scope. Research would make up a large portion of any project attempting to solve the issue. Additionally, while software solutions can help by centralizing information or improving workflows, systemic changes in healthcare organizations would also be necessary.

2. **Making Medical Knowledge More Accessible**: Medical research is difficult for non-specialists to understand due to complex terminology and fragmented sources, limiting access to crucial information.

   I selected this problem because it combined a common problem I noticed in the medical field across several use cases: public health awareness, patient education, research accessibility, etc. Solutions to this problem could leverage new technologies, like LLMs, and have a major impact on the livelihood of others.

3. **Lack of Peer-to-Peer Discussion Spaces**: Non-experts and early learners lack a centralized platform to discuss research and ask questions.

   I chose not to select this problem because similar platforms already exist for discussion spaces about specific topics. There isn't enough differentiation to create a software solution specifically for a non-expert medical field discussion space. As a result, there won’t be enough incentive to switch from one platform to another.

### Domain 2: Making Education Accessible

1. **Limited Peer or Mentorship Networks**: Students may lack mentors or peers who can guide them in exploring careers, projects, or learning about potential career paths.

   I chose not to select this problem because, while software could expand mentorship opportunities, it would only partially address the problem. Many barreiers to mentorship are systemic or localized, going beyond the scope of a software-focused project.

2. **Limited Exposure to Emerging Fields**: Traditional guidance and education may focus on conventional careers, leaving students unaware of new or interdisciplinary opportunities.

   I chose not to select this problem because existing online resources already provide exposure to emerging fields. Creating a new platform would risk duplicating search engine functionality without offering a distinct advantage, making the project less impactful.

3. **Inequitable Skill Assessment**: Students may not know which skills they already have or which skills are valued for certain career paths, limiting their ability to plan learning effectively.

   I selected this problem beacuse it aligns well with a software solution that can consolidate information, track skill development, and provide structured guidance. A tool could help students clarify interests, identify gaps, and plan actionable steps toward career-related skills.

### Domain 3: Collecting Poems

1. **Difficulty Finding Poems**: Discovering poems that match a particular theme, style, or mood cna be challenging.

   I chose not to select this problem because existing search engines, literary websites, and recommendation platforms can already address this issue. People who enjoy poetry may have established discovery routines and preferences, making a new platform struggle to attract sustained engagement.

2. **Saving and Organizing Poems**: Once found, poems are difficult to save, categorize, or annotate for future reference, limiting reflection and long-term engagement.

   I chose not to select this problem because it overlaps significantly with the poem discovery issue above. Improving organizaiton would most likely be a secondary feature of a discovery-focused tool, not a primary problem to solve.

3. **Limited Access to Multilingual Poems**: Poems in different languages -- particularly those outside mainstream literary markets -- are often inaccessible, and analyzing them across languages can be difficult.

   I selected this problem because software can be used to create a collaborative environment where users share insights, interpretations, and analyses. LLMs can be leveraged to help with translation, reducing language barriers and consolidating this information in one place.

## Stakeholders
