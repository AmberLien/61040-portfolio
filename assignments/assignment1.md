### Selected Domains

1. **Exploring Medical Research**

   Through proofreading friends’ abstracts and papers, I’ve learned about topics that affect me, like the git microbiome, and innovations like AI in radiology. However, medical terminology and the sheer volume of research often leave me struggling to fully understand what I read. This makes cutting-edge discoveries feel distant, even when they directly impact my health and curiosity.

2. **Collecting Poems**

   After reading “Wild Geese” by Mary Oliver, I began collecting poems to revisit and reflect on. Right now, my process is scattered – I browse different forums, follow conversations, and stumble upon poems I like; it’s a slow and unstructured process. I hope for an easier way to discover new poems and better understand which styles resonate with me.

3. **Making Education Accessible**

   When I came to MIT, I discovered dozens of activities and career paths I hadn’t known existed — Science Olympiads, computing competitions, and acronyms I’d never even heard of. Having the chance to explore these fields earlier would have been exciting and made the daunting decision of choosing a career path feel more manageable. It feels unfair that access to these opportunities is often limited, leaving some students unaware of paths they might excel in or enjoy.

## Problems

### Domain 1: Exploring Medical Research

1. **Doctors Using Outdated Technologies**: Healthcare professionals may rely on outdated methods or tools because emerging research is siloed across different fields.

   I chose not to select this problem because of its scope. Research would make up a large portion of any project attempting to solve the issue. Additionally, while software solutions can help resolve the issue, there are systemic changes that need to be made alongside software to effectively address the issue.

2. **Making Medical Knowledge More Accessible**: Medical research is difficult for non-specialists to understand due to complex terminology and fragmented sources, limiting access to crucial information.

   I selected this problem because it combined a common problem I noticed in the medical field across several use cases: patient awareness, research accessibility, etc. Solutions to this problem can leverage new technologies, like LLMs, and have a major impact on the livelihood of others.

3. **Lack of Peer-to-Peer Discussion Spaces**: Non-experts and early learners lack a centralized platform to discuss research and ask questions.

   Other platforms already exist giving people discussion spaces for topics of interest. There won’t be enough incentive to switch from one platform to another.

### Domain 2: Making Education Accessible

1. **Limited Peer or Mentorship Networks**: Students may lack mentors or peers who can guide them in exploring careers, projects, or learning about potential career paths.

   While software could expand mentorship opportunities, systemic barriers and localized networks mean that a tool would only partially address the problem.

2. **Limited Exposure to Emerging Fields**: Traditional guidance and education may focus on conventional careers, leaving students unaware of new or interdisciplinary opportunities (AI, biotech, renewable energy, etc.).

   Existing online resources already provide exposure to emerging fields, making a new platform less differentiated and less impactful.

3. **Inequitable Skill Assessment**: Students may not know which skills they already have or which skills are valued for certain career paths, limiting their ability to plan learning effectively.

   This problem aligns well with a software solution that can consolidate information, track skill development, and provide structured guidance. A tool could help students clarify interests, identify gaps, and plan actionable steps toward career-related skills.

### Domain 3: Collecting Poems

1. **Difficulty Finding Poems**: Discovering poems that match a particular theme, style, or mood cna be challenging, especially when you're unfamiliar with authors or sources.

   Existing search engines, literary websites, and recommendation platforms already partially address this issue, making it less impactful as a project focus.

2. **Saving and Organizing Poems**: Once found, poems are difficult to save, categorize, or annotate for future reference, limiting reflection and long-term engagement.

   This problem overlaps significantly with "Difficulty Finding Poems." Improving organizaiton would most likely be a secondary feature of a discovery-focused tool rather than a primary problem to solve.

3. **Limited Access to Multilingual Poems**: Poems in different languages -- particularly those outside mainstream literary markets -- are often inaccessible, and analyzing them across languages can be difficult.

   Software can be used to create a collaborative nevironment where users share insights, interpretations, and analyses, enhancing udnerstanding and engagement with poetry. LLMs can be leveraged to help with translation, consolidating this information in one place.

## Stakeholders

### Problem 1: Making Medical Knowledge More Accessible

1. **Patients and Family Members**: The users who uses the application to make informed decisions about treatments and ask questions.

2. **Prospective Health Care Professionals/Students**: The user who uses the application as a means of learning.

3. **Doctors and Healthcare Providers**: The user who uses the application as a resource to supplement while busy.

**Impact**: Patients and family members can attain access to comprehensible medical information, allowing them to make better-informed decisions about health, ask targeted questions, and feel less anxious about care. Doctors and healthcare providers will have an application that, when time is limited, they can direct patients to, allowing them to focus on care while patients gain better understanding. They may additionally benefit from a centralized platform to keep current on research trends relevant to patient concerns. Students and prospective health care professionals will have a beginner-friendly platform that can serve as an entry point to medical knowledge, helping them learn foundational concepts and stay up-to-date with emerging research, which may improve future training and recruitment into healthcare.

### Problem 2: Inequitable Skill Assessment

1. **Students**: Users of the tool for exploring intersts, identifying existing skills, and tracking progress towards learned goals.

2. **Workers**: Indirect users of the tool, using the platform for insight about how their skills compare to emerging trends and innovations.

3. **Counselors**: Supports students in navigating educational career pathways.

**Impact**: Students can better explore their interests, identify existing skills, and keep track of progress towards their learned goals. Workers can use the platform as a way to assess how their skills compare to emerging trends and innovations in their field, helping them plan their continued professional development. Counselors can support students, leveraging the tool to identify students' strengths and gaps.

### Problem 3: Accessing Multilingual Poems

1. **Poem Readers**: Primary users who want to access poems in multiple languages.
2. **Poetry Scholars/Researchers**: Using multilingual works for analysis, translation studies, or compariative literature.
3. **Family Members/Cultural Communities**: Indirectly affected by connecting to a specific culture or language a poem may use.

**Impact**: Limited access to multilingual poems affects several groups of stakeholders. Poem readers are prevented from discovering diverse cultural perspectives and enjoying works in their original language, limiting both enjoyment and learning. Poetry scholars and researchers face challenges in analyzing, translating, or comparing literary works, hindering academic exploration. Finally, family members and cultural communities may lose opportunities to preserve or share their heritage, weakening connections to language and culture. Improving access to multilingual poetry would therefore benefit readers, academics, and cultural communities alike, fostering engagement, understanding, and preservation of linguistic and literary diversity.
