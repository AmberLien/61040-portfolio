## Domains

1. **Collecting Poems**: Collecting poems to carry with me throughout the day.

2. **Drawing Realism**: Drawing realism, finding more reason to appreciate the world around me.

3. **Cooking**: Cooking family recipes to connect with my heritage.

4. **Listening to Music**: Listening to music and chasing the songs I can’t stop replaying.

5. **Following Analyses**: Following analyses to see my favorite pastimes in new ways.

6. **Learning Languages**: Learning languages to stay connected with my family.

7. **Studying Anatomy**: Exploring anatomy to understand the body’s intricate design.

8. **Learning about Space**: Learning about space to marvel at the mysteries of the universe.

9. **Making Education Accessible**: Exploring resources, opportunities, research, and career paths.

10. **Exploring Medical Research**: Exploring medical research to understand cutting-edge discoveries.

### Selected Domains

1. **Exploring Medical Research**

   Through proofreading friends’ abstracts and papers, I’ve learned about topics that affect me, like the git microbiome, and innovations like AI in radiology. However, medical terminology and the sheer volume of research often leave me struggling to fully understand what I read. This makes cutting-edge discoveries feel distant, even when they directly impact my health and curiosity.

2. **Collecting Poems**

   After reading “Wild Geese” by Mary Oliver, I began collecting poems to revisit and reflect on. Right now, my process is scattered – I browse different forums, follow conversations, and stumble upon poems I like; it’s a slow and unstructured process. I hope for an easier way to discover new poems and better understand which styles resonate with me.

3. **Making Education Accessible**

   When I came to MIT, I discovered dozens of activities and career paths I hadn’t known existed — Science Olympiads, computing competitions, and acronyms I’d never even heard of. Having the chance to explore these fields earlier would have been exciting and made the daunting decision of choosing a career path feel more manageable. It feels unfair that access to these opportunities is often limited, leaving some students unaware of paths they might excel in or enjoy.

## Problems

### Domain 1: Exploring Medical Research

1. **Doctors Using Outdated Technologies**: Healthcare professionals may rely on outdated methods or tools because emerging research is siloed across different fields.

   I chose not to select this problem because of its scope. Research would make up a large portion of any project attempting to solve the issue. Additionally, while software solutions can help resolve the issue, there are systemic changes that need to be made alongside software to effectively address the issue.

2. **Making Medical Knowledge More Accessible**: Medical research is difficult for non-specialists to understand due to complex terminology and fragmented sources, limiting access to crucial information.

   I selected this problem because it combined a common problem I noticed in the medical field across several use cases: patient awareness, research accessibility, etc. Solutions to this problem can leverage new technologies, like LLMs, and have a major impact on the livelihood of others.

3. **Lack of Peer-to-Peer Discussion Spaces**: Non-experts and early learners lack a centralized platform to discuss research and ask questions.

   Other platforms already exist giving people discussion spaces for topics of interest. There won’t be enough incentive to switch from one platform to another.

### Domain 2: Nagivating College

1. **Limited Exposure to Opportunities**: High school students often aren't aware of activities, competition, or career paths that eexist, making it hard to explore interests before commiting to a college major or career.

2. **Barriers to Peer Learning**

## Stakeholders

### Problem 1: Making Medical Knowledge More Accessible

1. **Patients and Family Members**: The users who uses the application to make informed decisions about treatments and ask questions.

2. **Prospective Health Care Professionals/Students**: The user who uses the application as a means of learning.

3. **Doctors and Healthcare Providers**: The user who uses the application as a resource to supplement while busy.

**Impact**: Patients and family members can attain access to comprehensible medical information, allowing them to make better-informed decisions about health, ask targeted questions, and feel less anxious about care. Doctors and healthcare providers will have an application that, when time is limited, they can direct patients to, allowing them to focus on care while patients gain better understanding. They may additionally benefit from a centralized platform to keep current on research trends relevant to patient concerns. Students and prospective health care professionals will have a beginner-friendly platform that can serve as an entry point to medical knowledge, helping them learn foundational concepts and stay up-to-date with emerging research, which may improve future training and recruitment into healthcare.

## Evidence

### Problem 1: Making Medical Knowledge More Accessible

1. [The Impacts of Health Literacy](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-022-08527-9): A study of hospitalized patients found that only 50% had adequate health literacy, while 32% were inadequate and 18% marginal. Patients with inadequate health literacy were three times more likely to revisit the emergency department within 90 days compared to those with adequate literacy. Gaps in understanding medical information can directly impact health outcomes and strain healthcare systems.

2. [Why 90% of Americans Struggle with Healthcare Literacy](https://healthcaregps.ai/blog/2025/03/breaking-down-health-literacy-90-percent-americans-struggle): Nearly 90% of American adults struggle to understand basic healthcare information largely due to confusing terminology and poorly designed patient materials. Plain-language communication and technology tools are some recommendations to bridge this gap.

3. [Scholarly PDFs are Largely Inaccesible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03022): An analysis of 20,000 scholarly PDFs published from 2014-2023 found that only 3.2% met all six key accessibility criteria such as tagged structuer, alt text, and correct reading order. 74.9% failed to meet _any_ of the accessibility criteria. Even when medical research is made publicly available, most remains inaccessible to users relying on assistive tools.

4. [Online Health Searches are Common but Unreliable](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2013/01/15/health-online-2013/): A 2013 Pew study found that 72% of internet users search for health information online. Searches mostly start via search engines (77%), with few users posting reviews or sharing knowledge. People actively seek medical information, but it's often fragmented.
5. [Risk of Oversimplification](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8241231/): A study from PCORI found that simplifying medical research summaries can improve patient udnerstnding but it also risks omitting crucial details, leading to misinterpretation or incomplete comprehension. This highlights the need for tools that strike a careful balance between making information accessible and preserving essential medical content.
6. [MedlinePlus' Design](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1324769): MedlinePlus offers a comprehensive online health information resource. While it serves as a valueable tool, users have reported challenges iwth teh complexity of medical terminology and limited interactivity. A study published in the _Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association_ highlighted that users struggle to navigate the site effectively.

## Features

### Problem 1: Making Medical Knowledge More Accessible

1. **LLM Summary**: You can leverage LLMs to summarize medical research into plain language; users can interact with a chatbot to adjust depth or focus. In doing so, medical information can be made more understandable for patients, families, and early learners.
2. **Use-Case Filtering**: You can filter content by condition, research topic, treatment options, etc. Filters will help guide users to infromation relevant to their interests, reducing overwhelming reearch from massive databases.
3. **Bookmarking**: Users can save summaries, articles, or past conversations for future reference. This enables easy revisiting and organization of medical knowledge, supporting ongoing learning and reference for patients, students, and caregivers.
