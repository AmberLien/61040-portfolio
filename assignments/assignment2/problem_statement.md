# Problem Statement

Below is the problem statement for Assignment 2.

## Problem Domain

**Exploring Medical Research**

I've been exposed to a wide range of medical topics while proofreading my friends' abstracts and research papers. These topics range from areas that directly affect me, like the gut microbiome, to emerging innovations such as AI in radiology. I've noticed that I often struggle to fully understand what I read due to the dense and highly specialized terminology common in medical writing.

Improving accessibility in this space would help me focus on the clarity and structure of the work I'm proofreading and would make valuable medical knowledge accessible to a broader audience.

## Problem

Medical research articles are often written with highly specialized terminology that assumes extensive background knowledge. This makes papers difficult to understand for non-specialists, like patients or caregivers.

When readers encounter unfamiliar terms, they have to pause their reading to search for definitions across scattered resources. This disrupts learning, increases the risk of misinterpretation, and discourages people from engaging deeply with medical information. As a result, even when accurate medical research is freely available, it remains effectively inaccessible to many of the people who can benefit most from it.

## Stakeholders

1. **Patients** are users who want to better understand their condition and treatment options.
2. **Family Members** are users who support patients.
3. **Prospective Health Care Professionals/Students** are individuals who explore research as a means of learning.
4. **Doctors and Healthcare Providers** are professionals who want to communicate treatment plans effectively.
5. **Teachers** are educators seeking resources to make medical concepts accessible.

Patients and family members can attain access to comprehensible medical information, allowing them to make better-informed decisions about health, ask targeted questions, and feel less anxious about care. Doctors and healthcare providers will have an application that, when time is limited, they can direct patients to, allowing them to focus on care while patients gain better understanding. Students and prospective health care professionals will have a beginner-friendly platform that can serve as an entry point to medical knowledge, helping them learn foundational concepts and stay up-to-date with emerging research, which may improve future training and recruitment into healthcare. Teachers can likewise find a platform to direct students to as an additional resource.

## Evidence

1. [The Impacts of Health Literacy](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-022-08527-9): A study of hospitalized patients found that only 50% had adequate health literacy, while 32% were inadequate and 18% marginal; patients with inadequate health literacy were three times more likely to revisit the emergency department within 90 days compared to those with adequate literacy. Gaps in understanding medical information can directly impact health outcomes and strain healthcare systems.

2. [Why 90% of Americans Struggle with Healthcare Literacy](https://healthcaregps.ai/blog/2025/03/breaking-down-health-literacy-90-percent-americans-struggle): Nearly 90% of American adults struggle to understand basic healthcare information largely due to confusing terminology and poorly designed patient materials. Plain-language communication and technology tools are some recommendations to bridge this gap.

3. [Online Health Searches are Common but Fragmented](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2013/01/15/health-online-2013/): A 2013 Pew study found that 72% of internet users search for health information online. Searches mostly start via search engines (77%), with few users posting reviews or sharing knowledge.

4. [Risk of Oversimplification](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8241231/): A study from PCORI found that simplifying medical research summaries can improve patient understanding but it also risks omitting crucial details. This highlights the need for tools that make information accessible while preserving essential medical content.

5. [MedlinePlus' Design](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1324769): MedlinePlus offers a comprehensive online health information resource. While it serves as a valueable tool, users have reported challenges with the complexity of medical terminology and limited interactivity.

6. [Medical terminology can Confuse Patients](https://med.umn.edu/news/medical-terminology-can-be-confusing-patients): A study published in JAMA Network Open found that medical professionals often use terminology that patients misunderstand. For example, 21% of patients believed the phrase "your tumor is progressing" meant good news.

7. [Forum Discussions Include Frustrations about Medical Terminology](https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1chvccl/what_do_we_think_about_using_medical_terminology): Some users in a discussion on a subreddit for disabilities about medical terminology have discussed frustrations with communicating with doctors using medical terminology, making conditions harder to understand.
